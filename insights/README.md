### Executive Summary

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of construction-related costs and revenues across multiple categories, suppliers, over period between 2017 and 2018. Total revenue generated is ₦826,039.48, with an average revenue of ₦19,667.61 from a total of 42 suppliers. Equipment-related expenses dominate overall costs, while revenue trends show irregular spikes over time, indicating project-based spending rather than steady operational expenditure. The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor cost drivers, top suppliers with every suppliers' contributions, and spending patterns to support informed financial planning and cost control.

### Key Findings

Equipment costs are the primary cost driver, accounting for over 54% of total revenue (₦447.26K), significantly outweighing construction and indirect costs.

From November 2017 through August 2018 which is the reporting period, revenue exhibits significant fluctuations, including pronounced spikes in early 2018. These irregular peaks indicate that spending was largely influenced by major project-related transactions rather than steady recurring revenue.

A small number of suppliers (TULPA CONSULTORIA FINANNCEIRA - EIRELI under Construction category) contribute disproportionately to total costs, with the top suppliers (SEGA FILMAGENS - SA under Equipment category) accounting for a significant share of total revenue, indicating supplier concentration risk.

##3 Business Recommendations

Optimize equipment procurement strategy by negotiating bulk discounts or long-term contracts with key equipment suppliers to reduce the largest cost component.

Improve cost forecasting and budgeting by analyzing the causes of revenue spikes and aligning procurement schedules more evenly across project timelines to avoid cash flow strain.
